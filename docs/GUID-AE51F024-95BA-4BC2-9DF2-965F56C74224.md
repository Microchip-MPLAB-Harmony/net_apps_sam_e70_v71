# TCP/IP WolfSSL TCP Client

This configuration demonstrates creating an Internet client that uses the MPLAB Harmony TCP API to create a TCP/IP connection to a Web server. The connection can either be clear text, or it can use TLS to encrypt the connection with wolfSSL. The demonstration can use either IPv4 or IPv6.

This demonstration uses the NET\_PRES layer for encrypted communication through an external service provider for TLS support.

**TCP/IP TCP WolfSSL Client MHC Configuration**

The following Project Graph diagram shows the Harmony components included in the TCP Client demonstration application.

-   MHC is launched by selecting **Tools \> Embedded \> MPLAB® Harmony 3 Configurator** from the MPLAB X IDE and after successful database migration , TCP/IP demo project is ready to be configured and regenerated.

-   **TCP/IP Root Layer Project Graph**

    The root layer project shows that USART1 peripheral is selected to do read and write operation for TCP/IP commands.

    This is the basic configuration with SYS\_CONSOLE, SYS\_DEBUG and SYS\_COMMAND modules. These modules are required for TCP/IP command execution.

    **NOTE:-****FreeRTOS** component is required for RTOS application. For bare-metal \(non-RTOS\) **FreeRTOS** component should not be selected.

    The below snapshot provides the details of the wolfssl\_crypto, wolfSSL and presentation layer configuration.

    TCP sockets calculate the ISN using the wolfSSL crypto library.

-   **TCP/IP Required Application**

    TCP/IP demo use these application module components for this demo.

    **Announce** module to discover the Microchip devices within a local network.

    **DHCP Client** module to discover the IPv4 address from the nearest DHCP Server.

    **DNS Client** provides DNS resolution capabilities to the stack. During these components selection, the required transport and network modules are also selected.

-   **TCPIP Driver Layer**

    **Internal ethernet driver\(gmac\)** is enabled with the external **LAN8740 PHY driver** library for SAME70 demonstartion.

    ![tcpip_same70_v71_project](GUID-48399DC2-EE8A-44B7-A8EF-411D75C8A3D2-low.png)

    For **SAM V71** demonstration , **LAN8061 PHY driver** ia selcted along with GMAC **Internal ethernet driver**.

    ![tcpip_same70_v71_project](GUID-A9A5B923-0152-4FED-83C4-B21E2268B15F-low.png)

    The MIIM Driver supports asynchronous read/write and scan operations for accessing the external PHY registers and notification when MIIM operations have completed.


**TCP/IP TCP WolfSSL Client Hardware Configuration**

This section describes the hardware configuration for ATSAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit and one can be used for the respective application demonstration.

1.  This section describes the required default hardware configuration use SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit

    -   Ensure ERASE jumper is Open.

    -   Open the J805 Jumper

    -   Refer to the SAM E70/V71 Ethernet Starter Kit [User Guide](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/SAME70_Xplained_Ultra_Evaluation_User's%20Guide_DS70005389B.pdf)

        ![required_hardware](GUID-224B1E69-E08E-4BFF-8AFF-5FFFEB5313AC-low.png)

    -   Insert the LAN8740 PHY daughter board on the ETHERNET PHY MODULE header.

    -   Connect the micro USB cable from the computer to the DEBUG USB connector on the SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit

    -   Establish a connection between the router/switch with the SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit through the RJ45 connector

**Running Demonstration Steps**

1.  Build and download the demonstration project on the target board.

2.  If the board has a UART connection:

    1.  A virtual COM port will be detected on the computer, when the USB cable is connected to USB-UART connector.

    2.  Open a standard terminal application on the computer \(like Hyper-terminal or Tera Term\) and configure the virtual COM port.

    3.  Set the serial baud rate to 115200 baud in the terminal application.

    4.  See that the initialization prints on the serial port terminal.

    5.  When the DHCP client is enabled in the demonstration, wait for the DHCP server to assign an IP address for the development board. This will be printed on the serial port terminal.

        -   Alternatively: Use the Announce service or ping to get the IP address of the board.

        -   Run **tcpip\_discoverer.jar** to discover the IPv4 and IPv6 address for the board.

3.  Execution :

    As soon as a valid IP address is assigned through the DHCP to the demonstration, it is ready to accept console commands.

    There are three commands available in the demonstration from the serial port:

    openurl < url \> - The < url \> argument must be a fully formed URL; for instance, http://www.microchip.com/ ipmode < mode \> - The < mode \> argument selects the IP version. 0 - Any IP version, 4 - IPv4 only, 6 - IPv6 only stats - Output the statistics of the previous openurl run. Statistics such as how long each phase of the connection took, and how many bytes were transferred.

    1.  After the successful broad bring up, the console output becomes

        ![tcpip_tcp_wolfssl_client_project](GUID-9304888B-767B-42C8-9F67-2261BBA85FCB-low.png)

    2.  Input the following command from the serial port: openurl < url \> - The < url \> argument must be a fully formed URL; for instance, https://www.microchip.com/.

        For this above URL , the DNS module will make a DNS query. Then it will open a connection to the requested URL and perform a simple HTTP GET command. The response received from the server will be printed on the terminal application through the serial port.

        The expected output -
