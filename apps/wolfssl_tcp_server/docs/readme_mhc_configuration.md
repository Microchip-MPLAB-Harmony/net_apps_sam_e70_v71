# TCP/IP TCP WolfSSL Server MHC Configuration

The following Project Graph diagram shows the Harmony components included in the TCP Client demonstration application.

* MHC is launched by selecting **Tools > Embedded > MPLABÂ® Harmony 3 Configurator** from the MPLAB X IDE and after successful database migration , TCP/IP demo project is ready to be configured and regenerated.

* **TCP/IP Root Layer Project Graph**

  The root layer project shows that USART1 peripheral is selected to do read and write operation for TCP/IP commands.

  This is the basic configuration with SYS_CONSOLE, SYS_DEBUG and SYS_COMMAND modules. These modules are required for TCP/IP command execution.

  **NOTE:-**  
  **FreeRTOS** component is required for RTOS application. For bare-metal (non-RTOS) **FreeRTOS** component should not be selected.

  The below snapshot provides the details of the wolfssl_crypto, wolfSSL and presentation layer configuration.

   TCP sockets calculate the ISN using the wolfSSL crypto library.

* **TCP/IP Required Application**

  TCP/IP demo use these application module components for this demo. 
  
  **Announce** module to discover the Microchip devices within a local network.
  
  **DHCP Client** module to discover the IPv4 address from the nearest DHCP Server.
  
  **DNS Client** provides DNS resolution capabilities to the stack.  During these components selection, the required transport and network modules are also selected.

* **TCPIP Driver Layer** 

  **Internal ethernet driver(gmac)** is enabled with the external **LAN8740 PHY driver** library for SAME70 demonstartion. 

    ![tcpip_same70_v71_project](images/tcpip_driver_component.png)

  For **SAM V71** demonstration , **LAN8061 PHY driver** ia selcted along with GMAC 
  **Internal ethernet driver**.

    ![tcpip_same70_v71_project](images/tcpip_driver_component_v71.png)

  The MIIM Driver supports asynchronous read/write and scan operations for accessing the external PHY registers and notification when MIIM operations have completed.
