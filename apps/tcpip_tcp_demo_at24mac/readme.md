# TCP/IP TCP Client Using ATMAC

The TCP Client configuration demonstrates creating a network client using AT24MAC with the MPLAB Harmony TCP API to make a TCP/IP connection to a web server.
The Atmel AT24MAC402 and AT24MAC602 provides 2048 bits of Serial Electrically-Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM) organized as 256 words of eight bits each and is accessed via an I2C-compatible (2-wire) serial interface.
