# TCP/IP WolfSSL TCP Client

This configuration demonstrates creating an Internet client that uses the MPLAB Harmony TCP API to create a TCP/IP connection to a Web server. The connection can either be clear text, or it can use TLS to encrypt the connection with wolfSSL. The demonstration can use either IPv4 or IPv6.

This demonstration uses the NET_PRES layer for encrypted communication through an external service provider for TLS support.
